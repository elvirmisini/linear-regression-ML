This script is implementing linear regression with one variable from scratch and comparing its performance with Scikit-Learn's implementation.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
 * Libraries: It starts by importing the required libraries - sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and seaborn.
 * warmUpExercise(): This function is a warm-up exercise function that returns a 5x5 identity matrix using the numpy's identity function.
 * computeCost(X, y, theta=[[0],[0]]): This function computes the cost for linear regression. It takes in X (input data), y (output data) and theta (parameters for hypothesis) and returns the cost (J).
 * gradientDescent(X, y, theta=[[0],[0]], alpha=0.01, num_iters=1500): This function performs gradient descent to learn the theta parameters. It takes in X (input data), y (output data), theta (parameters for hypothesis), alpha (learning rate) and num_iters (number of iterations) and returns theta (learned parameters) and J_history (history of cost).

In the __main__ section of the code:
 * It sets up some display options for pandas and seaborn.
 * It loads a dataset 'ex1data2.txt' using numpy's loadtxt function. The data is assumed to be comma-separated with the first row to be skipped.
 * It separates the input (X) and output (y) data from the loaded dataset. A column of ones is also added to the input data to accommodate the theta_0 intercept term.
 * A scatter plot is created to show the dataset.
 * The initial cost is calculated using the computeCost function with initial theta values of 0.
 * It performs gradient descent with the initial theta values of 0, a learning rate of 0.01 and 1500 iterations to get the learned theta values and cost history. It then prints the learned theta values.
 * It plots the history of cost against the number of iterations.
 * It plots the line of best fit (hypothesis function) against the dataset using the learned theta values. It also plots the line of best fit using sklearn's LinearRegression for comparison.
 * It uses the learned theta values to predict the profit for cities with populations of 35000 and 70000.
 * It generates a grid of theta_0 and theta_1 values and computes the cost for each combination.
 * It then creates a 2D contour plot and a 3D surface plot of the cost function against the theta values. The learned theta values are also marked on the plots.

 Results:
 theta:  [-3.63029144  1.16636235]
[4519.7678677]
[45342.45012945]


Gradient Descent and Normal Equation are two different methods for finding the optimal parameters for a linear regression model. Here are the main differences between the two methods in the context of the script you posted:

**Gradient Descent:**

1. *Iterative:* Gradient Descent is an iterative algorithm. It starts with an initial guess for the parameters (theta in the script), and then repeatedly adjusts these parameters to make the cost function smaller. The adjustments continue until the cost function converges to a minimum value.

2. *Learning Rate:* In Gradient Descent, a learning rate (alpha in the script) must be chosen. This parameter controls how big of a step the algorithm takes in each iteration. If the learning rate is too large, the cost function may not converge, while if it's too small, the cost function may take too long to converge.

3. *Feature Scaling:* Before applying Gradient Descent, it's a good idea to normalize or standardize the features (as the script does). This helps the cost function converge more quickly.

4. *Large Datasets:* Gradient Descent can be more suitable for cases where the number of features or the number of training examples is very large. In such cases, computing the normal equation could be computationally expensive or even infeasible.

**Normal Equation:**

1. *Analytical Solution:* The Normal Equation provides a direct, analytical solution for the optimal parameters of a linear regression model. There's no need to choose a learning rate or iterate until convergence - you just solve the equation in one step.

2. *No Feature Scaling:* With the Normal Equation, there's no need to normalize or standardize the features.

3. *Computational Complexity:* The Normal Equation involves matrix multiplication and finding the inverse of a matrix. The time complexity for these operations can be high (up to O(n^3) with the number of features n), so the Normal Equation could be slow or even infeasible if the number of features is very large. However, for datasets with a moderate number of features (up to a few thousand), the Normal Equation is often fast enough and can be a good choice.

In summary, while Gradient Descent and Normal Equation can both be used to find the parameters for a linear regression model, they have different strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and problem.
